                        By visiting the website of Trade Guru Academy, a division of Learner's Global Gurukul LLP, 
                        you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree
                         please do not use or access our Website.  </p>


                
                    <p>By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure
                         of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy 
                         Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.  </p>

                    <p>   When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal 
                        information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in 
                        doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience.
                         This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs,
                          and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. 
                          More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we
                           consider necessary for achieving this purpose.  </p>

                    <p>  In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.  </p>

                    <p>  We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie".  </p>

                    <p>  We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.  </p>

                    <p> Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.  </p>

                    <p> If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information about your buying behaviour.  </p>

                    <p>   If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or money orders.  </p>

                    <p>   We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with us. While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.  </p>

                    <p>   We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect money; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.  </p>

                    <p>   In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our Website.  </p>

                    <p>   We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.  </p>

                    <p>   We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our Website, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in and to display content according to your preferences.  </p>

                    <p>   We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates to help detect and prevent identity theft, fraud and other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to prevent abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co-branded services that you request where such services are provided by more than one corporate entity.  </p>
